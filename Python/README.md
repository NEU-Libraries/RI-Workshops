# Northeastern Library Python Workshops

These workshops were developed using the Software Carpentry Python lessons (both the [Programming in Python](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/) and the [Plotting and Programming in Python](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/).

## Organization

The lessons are

+ Python-1
+ Python-2
+ Python-3

Each lesson is developed in Jupyter Notebook and has a "slides" version (used during the workshop) and the "instructor" version - which has all code.

## Additional Resources

The Snell Library has a lot of additional resources for those interested in learning Python. There are a number of great videos and books in the [Safari Learning Platform](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/), which should be accessible on campus. You'll have to create an account using your Northeastern email but after that you shoud be set.

Useful titles include: Learn Python the Hardway by Zed A. Shaw, Learn Python in 7 Days, and Learn to Program with Python 3. There are also titles like Learn Raspberry Pi Programming with Python, Learn Data Analysis with Python, and Python Business Intelligence Cookbook.

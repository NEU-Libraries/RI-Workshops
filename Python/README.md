# Northeastern Library Python Workshops

These workshops were developed using the Software Carpentry Python lessons (both the [Programming in Python](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/) and the [Plotting and Programming in Python](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/).

## Organization

The lessons are

+ Python-1
+ Python-2
+ Python-3

Each lesson is developed in Jupyter Notebook and has a "slides" version (used during the workshop) and the "instructor" version - which has all code.

I've also included the data files in the "data" folder. 

## Additional Resources

The Snell Library has a lot of additional resources for those interested in learning Python. There are a number of great videos and books in the [Safari Learning Platform](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/), which should be accessible on campus. You'll have to create an account using your Northeastern email but after that you shoud be set.

Useful titles include: [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://onesearch.library.northeastern.edu/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=NEU_ALMA51284615730001401&context=L&vid=NU&search_scope=default_scope&tab=default_tab&lang=en_US) by Zed A. Shaw, [Learn Python in 7 Days](https://onesearch.library.northeastern.edu/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=NEU_ALMA51284615570001401&context=L&vid=NU&search_scope=default_scope&tab=default_tab&lang=en_US), and [Learn to Program with Python 3](https://onesearch.library.northeastern.edu/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=NEU_ALMA51286617110001401&context=L&vid=NU&search_scope=default_scope&tab=default_tab&lang=en_US).
